      <p>The Software program is HUNCHâ€™s newest program and seeks to have students work with NASA to build software
        applications for the International Space Station. Students work on project prompts sourced from crew feedback
        and subject matter experts to solve real needs for astronauts and the International Space Station.<br>

        <br>Each project that the students work on is team based and while programming is a core part of software
        development, it is not the only component that makes a software product a success. Emphasis is placed on
        delivering working products at the end of the school year and having teams that focus on software development,
        design, quality assurance, and user testing. Solutions to these projects are intentionally open ended and meant
        to mirror real life software product development processes.<br>

        <br>Projects are also designed to expose students to range of different types of software development. Examples
        this year included tracking items on the space station using IoT devices, building a mobile web application to
        allow an astronaut to have a personalized mission timeline, to software to help astronauts identify spacecraft
        parts using cutting edge technologies such as augmented reality.

      <h3>Design & Prototype</h3>
      <div class="design-proto indv-programs">

        <p>The Design and Prototyping HUNCH Program is a way for students of all skill levels to develop innovative
          solutions to problems posed by life on the International Space Station. Many of the projects are items
          personally requested by the International Space Station Crew to help ease living conditions aboard station,
          giving students the opportunity to really make an impact on the lives of Astronauts. Other projects come from
          Flight Crew Systems and Operational groups at NASA that need more idea development.<br>

          <br>Students from all over the United States partner with mentors at NASA Research Centers across the country
          to develop unique solutions. This wide swath of ideas allows us to pull in the best ideas at each center,
          bringing students together nationwide to collaborate and present the very best they can offer at our Design
          Reviews. This year we are preparing a new schedule of design reviews to help keep the process moving forward
          and bring the best ideas to the forefront. Our goal is to bring the best ideas from each project together for
          a final review at Johnson Space Center where they can be reviewed in greater detail.
