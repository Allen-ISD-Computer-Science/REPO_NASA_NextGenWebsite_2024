    <h3 class="left-pgrm">Software</h3>
    <div class="software indv-programs">
      <img class="software-img" src="https://nasahunch.com/images/software.jpg">

      <p>The Software program is HUNCH’s newest program and seeks to have students work with NASA to build software
        applications for the International Space Station. Students work on project prompts sourced from crew feedback
        and subject matter experts to solve real needs for astronauts and the International Space Station.<br>

        <br>Each project that the students work on is team based and while programming is a core part of software
        development, it is not the only component that makes a software product a success. Emphasis is placed on
        delivering working products at the end of the school year and having teams that focus on software development,
        design, quality assurance, and user testing. Solutions to these projects are intentionally open ended and meant
        to mirror real life software product development processes.<br>

        <br>Projects are also designed to expose students to range of different types of software development. Examples
        this year included tracking items on the space station using IoT devices, building a mobile web application to
        allow an astronaut to have a personalized mission timeline, to software to help astronauts identify spacecraft
        parts using cutting edge technologies such as augmented reality.

      <h3>Design & Prototype</h3>
      <div class="design-proto indv-programs">
        <img class="des-proto-img" src="https://nasahunch.com/images/design.jpg">

        <p>The Design and Prototyping HUNCH Program is a way for students of all skill levels to develop innovative
          solutions to problems posed by life on the International Space Station. Many of the projects are items
          personally requested by the International Space Station Crew to help ease living conditions aboard station,
          giving students the opportunity to really make an impact on the lives of Astronauts. Other projects come from
          Flight Crew Systems and Operational groups at NASA that need more idea development.<br>

          <br>Students from all over the United States partner with mentors at NASA Research Centers across the country
          to develop unique solutions. This wide swath of ideas allows us to pull in the best ideas at each center,
          bringing students together nationwide to collaborate and present the very best they can offer at our Design
          Reviews. This year we are preparing a new schedule of design reviews to help keep the process moving forward
          and bring the best ideas to the forefront. Our goal is to bring the best ideas from each project together for
          a final review at Johnson Space Center where they can be reviewed in greater detail.

    <div class="bioMed indv-programs">
      <img class="bioMed-img software-img" src="https://nasahunch.com/images/biomed-program-card-image.jpg">

      <p>The NASA HUNCH Health and Biomedical Science Program aims to bring innovative ideas to the Human Research
        Program (HRP) and NASA Flight doctors, fostering excitement for health and biomedical science crucial for future
        long-duration space missions. The program encourages students to brainstorm solutions and construct study
        presentations, engaging with knowledgeable individuals to clarify and refine their ideas.<br>

        <br>Participants follow requirements and constraints while having the freedom to explore unique solutions
        tailored for the unique environment of microgravity (micro-G) or reduced gravity environments. The video
        transcript introduces the program, managed by Ali Westover, highlighting its initiation to address the
        healthcare challenges of future NASA exploration missions. It emphasizes the importance of understanding how the
        human body operates in microgravity and the need to bridge the healthcare gap for astronauts.<br>

        <br>Various projects from NASA organizations, flight surgeons, human research program members, and payload
        operations groups are presented, covering topics like mental health, IV fluid delivery, medical operations, and
        3D printing solutions. The program timeline spans fall to early spring, featuring preliminary design reviews and
        critical design reviews, where mentors provide feedback to guide students in developing their solutions.

      <h3>Hardware</h3>
      <div class="hardware design-proto indv-programs">
        <img class="hardware-img des-proto-img" src="https://nasahunch.com/images/hardware.jpg">

        <p>Space Flight Equipment is one of HUNCH’s largest programs allowing us to create high quality hardware items
          for the International Space Station. With many different applications we create items from approved design
          projects to requested items from Crew Systems. Since these projects are likely to fly to the International
          Space Station they need to be of the highest quality and meet the stringent tolerances applied to all hardware
          for the International Space Station.<br>

          <br>Many of our most successful projects are items requested by the Astronaut Crew and developed through our
          Design and Prototyping program. Items such as the Galley Table help with crew comfort as well as other items
          providing maintenance solutions that keep the International Space Station running for a long time to come.
          With our largest project of Stowage Lockers of various sizes to hold experiments we are working at our highest
          quality, pushing students to produce the very best work possible.<br>

          <br>Since most items are built to drawing specifications they need to show the highest quality output possible
          from our schools. We teach students about quality assurance best practices so that they learn to expect
          quality from all of the items they create. They are also shown proper safety documentation throughout the
          process making them more accountable for their output insuring tractability from start to finish. We want to
          insure that all HUNCH product meet the highest quality standards possible so that student work has the best
          chance of reaching the International Space Station.

      <img class="culinary-img software-img" src="https://nasahunch.com/images/culinary.jpg">

      <p>The Astronaut Culinary Challenge develops food items for the Astronauts aboard the International Space Station
        from a general theme idea. Each year there is a new theme given out to the schools where the students create new
        dishes taking into account food processing procedure and nutritional requirements so that their items will meet
        the standards of the NASA Johnson Space Center Food Lab. With the growing culinary program we’re excited to
        bring in a wider range of students and show how research into space isn’t limited to only STEM fields, as well
        as educating students in researching and presenting their work in a professional environment.<br>

        <br>Nation wide we have 33 different schools creating many entrees to be brought into their local center for a
        taste competition with different food industry professionals and personnel from the center. After these
        preliminary culinary competitions, those with the highest scores from across the country are invited to Johnson
        Space Center for a final competition where their work will be judged by Food Lab personnel, industry
        professionals, ISS program office, and Astronauts for quality, taste, their work on the research paper, and
        presentation video. The winning entree will be processed by the Johnson Space Center Food Lab and sent up to the
        station for the astronauts to enjoy.

      <img class="sewn-articles-img software-img" src="https://nasahunch.com/images/softgoods.jpg">

      <p>HUNCH Sewn Flight Articles, also known as Softgoods, is a program using fabric and other soft materials to create goods requested by different NASA centers as well as the International Space Station Astronaut Crew. This can range from redesigning the crew pantry to creating kits for the Crew’s personal items. Softgoods provides a unique design opportunity using various materials to keep the crew not only safe but clean and comfortable aboard their stay.<br>

      <br>Much of our output goes to items for training purposes. By creating high fidelity training goods we can give the Astronaut Crew a more realistic simulation while they are on the ground. These products range from items we’ve designed through Design and Prototyping and had flown up to the International Space Station as well as items that already exist aboard the International Space Station such as Cargo Bags. This range of items allows schools with different skill levels to all participate so that no one is denied the chance to create.<br>

      <br>Since most items are built to drawing specifications they need to show the highest quality output possible from our schools. We teach students about quality assurance best practices so that they learn to expect quality from all of the items they create. They are also shown proper safety documentation throughout the process making them more accountable for their output insuring tractability from start to finish.

      <div class="design-proto indv-programs">
        <img class="flight-config-img des-proto-img" src="https://nasahunch.com/images/flight-configuration-card-image.jpg">

        <p>At the start of the school year, students in the Flight Configuration program will work with NASA HUNCH Mentors - Mike Bennett and Luke Sammons to bring their selected project designs and drawings up to NASA drafting and manufacturing standards. This includes producing completed flight drawings, documentation, and final 3D prints if needed.<br>

          <br>Your students may be continuing to work on their project from the previous school year, or they could be working on a project new to them that was chosen to move on to flight and needs to be brought to completion.<br>

          <br>Also, at times we have organizations within NASA that approach HUNCH with a project that must be created in a short period of time. The Flight Configuration students’ skills make them the perfect choice for these types of projects.<br>

          <br>When their designs are ready for production in one of our HUNCH schools, the project will go through all the industry safety and design requirements as any other product that is launched to the international space station</p>
